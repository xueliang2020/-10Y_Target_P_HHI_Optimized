This is based on the version that used for the 2020 Q3 Stress Testing, and used for the life-time ECap proxy model that used for deal pricing.

Base Assumptions:
1. 15%, 15% percentage for Non-Regional as a cap withint SBL and NSBL respectively
2. China 10% as a cap withint SBL and NSBL respectively
3. NSBL has a cap that any individual country share will never be bigger than the max of Sovereign share
4. All concerntration limits using the DOB to adjust. (including top 1 and top 3 sovereign limits)
5. Final ECap input EAD will need to be mapped using the EAD from Stress Testing process, applying the country share
6. Avg rating target is 6.5 and 7.5 respectively
7. Approved, Pipeline used the same snapshot that same with previous version update
8. PD and ratings used the same Oct 2020 version, not udpated, no downgrade yet


Updated Assumptions & Logics:
1. 50%, 25%, 25% among the GDP weighted , Approved and Pipeline as the share. (changed from the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 share)
2. Previously, we also cap China share with 10% in the first step of GDP model process, now we removed the 10% china cap, only let the algorithm to freely adjust later.
3. we generated serval results based on the adjustment order, as we realized the order matters, there is no unique solution for the question.



TODO:
1. permutation to cover all tthe possible permutations of the adjustments, and get all the possible solutions, and find a most optomized one as the solution
